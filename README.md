## 🏗️ Hybrid Architecture: Best of Both Worlds

### 🎯 **Strategic Approach**
School Website Builder uses a **hybrid architecture** that combines the best of modern web development with proven content management capabilities:

- **Frontend**: Next.js for lightning-fast public website
- **Backend**: WordPress as dedicated CMS for content management
- **Separation**: Complete separation of concerns for optimal performance

### 🚀 **Performance & Speed**
- **Lightning Fast Frontend**: Next.js delivers optimal performance for public visitors
- **Dedicated CMS**: WordPress handles content management without affecting frontend performance

- **School Administrators**: Focus on school management without technical complexity
- **Media Team**: Efficient content workflow with WordPress's proven CMS
- **Developers**: Modern frontend development with Next.js

### 🔒 **Security & Reliability**

- **Content Security**: CMS access restricted to authorized personnel only
- **Regular Updates**: Both systems receive regular security updates

### 💰 **Cost-Effective Solution**
- **No Frontend Plugin Costs**: Public website doesn't need expensive WordPress plugins
- **Familiar CMS**: Use existing WordPress knowledge and plugins for content management
- **Optimized Hosting**: Frontend can use static hosting, CMS uses standard WordPress hosting
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear separation of costs between frontend and CMS

### 🎨 **Designer-Developer Collaboration**

- **Familiar CMS**: Designers and content creators use proven WordPress interface
- **API Integration**: Seamless data flow between WordPress CMS and Next.js frontend
- **Version Control**: Frontend code in Git, CMS content managed through WordPress

### 🔧 **Developer Experience**
- **Modern Stack**: Latest technologies for frontend development
